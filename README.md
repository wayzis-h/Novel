# Novel
The project is made solely for the educational purpose.

*Open-source visual novel made by self claimed schizophrenics.
**Don't get this serious** and don't pay much attention to the script, please.*\*

The game has built on .NET using C# and MonoGame Framework.
These technologies were chosen because of portability and personal familiarity with them.

In near future we expect adding basic functional of a novel:
- User interface that can fit most of screen ratio;
- Mechanism of creating consequences based on player input.
Additional objectives:
- Android platform support;
- Study of the VFX.

> \* We entirely condemn fascism.

# How to use
First you need Visual Studio 2022.
Then I recommend to [install](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html) MonoGame extension to the IDE, so you can edit the monogame content files in a simple GUI.
This should be enought to compile and run the program.
